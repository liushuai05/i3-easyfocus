# i3-easyfocus

Focus and select windows in [i3](https://github.com/i3/i3).

Draws a small label ('a'-'z') on top of each visible container, which can be selected by pressing the corresponding key on the keyboard (cancel with ESC). By default, only windows on the current workspace are labelled.

## Usage

Focus the selected window:

```shell
./i3-easyfocus
```

It also possible to only print out the con_id of the selected window and, for example, move it to workspace 3:

```shell
./i3-easyfocus -i | xargs -I {} i3-msg [con_id={}] move workspace 3
```

Or to print the window id and use it with other commands, like xkill:
```shell
./i3-easyfocus -w | xargs xkill -id
```

## Problems/Debugging

If there is a problem or you have an idea, please feel free to open a new issue.

In order to get more details about a problem you can build in debug mode, which will produce more log messages:
```
make clean debug
./i3-easyfocus
```



Quick Start (Podman)
Build

With a Containerfile in current directory, build an image with Containerfile:
```
podman build -t new_image .
```
Create Container
```
podman create --name new_container new_image
```
To forward port from host to container, use -p host:container, like that:
```
podman create --name new_container -p 8022:22 new_image
```
Tools like PRoot, gdb and strace requires ptrace() to work. You may want to enable this capability:
```
podman create --name new_container --cap-add sys_ptrace new_image
```
You may wish KVM and/or graphics device in container:
```
podman create --name new_container --device /dev/kvm --device /dev/dri --group-add keep-groups new_image
```
Start Container
```
podman start new_container
```
Run Program

Start bash in a tty:
```
podman exec -it new_container bash
```
Stop Container

Stop the container:
```
podman stop new_container
```
Cleanup

Delete image:
```
podman rm new_image
```
